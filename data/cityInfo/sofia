The visitor to the capital of Bulgaria should take time to make the short trip to Shipka. On a hillock above the town the gold plated domes of the memorial church stand as a constant token of thanks to Russian soldiers who gave their lives to save Bulgaria. The church is built in the Russian 17th century style: adorned with ceramics outside, gold plated cross and moldings within. The bells were made from the shells of old cannonballs.
