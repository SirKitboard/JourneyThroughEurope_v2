The capital of Spain lies high up on the Castilian plateau. The Prado is an absolute must for the visitor to Madrid. This unique museum owes its existence largely to the instigation of a foreigner: in 1810 Joseph Bonaparte, named King of Spain by Napoleon, decided to let the people see the sparkling collection of treasures owned by the Spanish state. The legitimate heirs to the Spanish crown have allowed the museum to flourish. Today it boasts the best examples of Spanish art from the 12th to the 18th centuries: EI Greco, Velasquez, Ribera, Murillo and Goya. Spain hosted the 1982 football World Cup, and the final was played in the magnificent Madrid stadium.
