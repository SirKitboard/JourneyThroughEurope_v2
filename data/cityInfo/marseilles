Marseilles has developed into one of France's major ports. In 1830 France conquered Algeria, and pi racy in the Mediterranean largely ceased. The second event to have a big impact on Marseilles was the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. The port became an important starting point for trade ships travelling to India and the Far East.
