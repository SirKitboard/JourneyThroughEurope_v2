The Alhambra is the famous castle of Granada, built of red brick. At the edge of the mountains, it adjoins the Alcazaba fortress, with its Arabian gardens and the Palace of Charles V. The Alcazaba was built in the 14th century by the Queen of Granada. Today it is a major tourist attraction. [t is possible to reach the fortress by car, but it's far more adventurous to walk up the side of the Paseo de los Tristes and experience the marvelous sight of Alcazaba coming slowly into view.
