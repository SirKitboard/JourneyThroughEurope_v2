Though Lisbon boasts such attractions as the bustling main street, Avenida da Liberdada (Liberty Avenue), and the romantic old part of the city, far and away the most beautiful area is the suburb of Belem. It was from here that Vasco da Gama began his voyage of discovery in 1496. Titled aristocrats and members of "high society" lived in Belem many years ago. The Tower of Belem was erected in 1520 and serves as a reminder of the glorious years when the Portuguese navy ruled the waves.
