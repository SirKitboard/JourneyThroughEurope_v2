The "Romer", three houses with highly individual gables, is the major landmark of Frankfurt. The actual "House of the Romans" islands in the middle of the three. On the upper floor is the Kaiser's Hall, where state banquets used to take place. Only the facades and some of the lower floors of the "Romer" remained after the heavy bombing Frankfurt endured during the last world war. The Kaiser's Hall needed totally reconstructing. The 52 portraits of Kaisers had been evacuated prior to the bombing, so they escaped damage. Another building
of great interest is Goethe's House. The poet spent his childhood and youth there.
