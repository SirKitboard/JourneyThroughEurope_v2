Stockholm established itself in the 13th century on a small island where the Malar flows into the Baltic. Today the Swedish capital is spread over 14 islands, making it a beautiful city full of bays, canals, rivers and bridges. One of the city's major tourist attractions is the ship "Wasa". Built is 1627, it was intended to serve as the flagship of Gustav Adolf II's navy. However, it sank in unfortunate circumstances in Stockholm harbor at the start of its maiden voyage in 1628. After numerous attempts, the wreck was finally raised three centuries later. It has been restored to its former glory and the "Wasa" museum has thousands of visitors each year.
