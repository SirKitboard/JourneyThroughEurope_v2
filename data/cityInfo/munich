This Bavarian metropolis is both a major center for the arts and an important industrial city. The many art galleries and museums preserve the works of numerous well known painters and sculptors, both local and from further afield. The city is also the home of one of Germany's largest commercial areas and one of its most successful film industries. In 1972 the Olympic Games were held in Munich. The focus of attention was the magnificent Olympic Stadium, and in particular its unique roof. One giant roofing area covers half of the stadium, the swimming hall, the sports hall and part of the entrance area. The roof is actually a vast steel net, slung from high stanchions around the Olympic area. The net is covered in clear reinforced plastic, so that sunlight can filter through.
