The islands form the most northerly part of Great Britain. The famous Shetland ponies graze the islands, as do flocks of sheep. The wool from these sheep is used to make some of the finest knitted garments in the world. Contact with the mainland is kept up by the regular ferry to Aberdeen, a 12 hour journey away.
