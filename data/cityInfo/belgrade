The capital city of Serbia lies at the spot where the Sava flows into the Danube. The old fortress of Kalimegdan towers above the two rivers. High on the hill, the upper part of the fortress has some particularly impressive sights, such as great archways and towering walls. Belgrade was once on the edge of the Turkish Empire, and the influence is still apparent in the mosque and SI Mark's Church.
