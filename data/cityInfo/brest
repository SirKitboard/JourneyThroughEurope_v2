Rebuilt after being almost totally destroyed in 1944, the town is now the most modern in Bretagne. The naval base is the largest in France, and the commercial harbor is also one of the country's most important. Brest is also a big sailing center. The harbor, which dates from the 17th century, can best be appreciated by taking an excursion on a boat. On the first Sunday of August there is always a Bagpipes Festival!
