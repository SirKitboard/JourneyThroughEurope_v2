At the foot of M t. Vesuvius, 12 miles east of Naples, lies the site of the Ancient Roman town of Pompeii. This is the most complete example of a Roman settlement in the whole of Italy. Pompeii was an important trading town of approximately 20,000 inhabitants. The town had already been damaged by an earthquake previously, but the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD totally destroyed Pompeii. Although many of the buildings were covered in up to twenty feet of ash and lava, they remained largely intact, and today they can be seen almost as they would have appeared all those centuries ago.
