For centuries, Strasbourg was an almost permanent theatre of war, as Germany and France struggled to control the city. Now, finally in France, Strasbourg has come to symbolize European unity, for it houses the European Parliament. The Parliament building was opened in 1979. In the old city itself, the visitor should take time to visit the beautiful cathedral and see its astrological clock.
