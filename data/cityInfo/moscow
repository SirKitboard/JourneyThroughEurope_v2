This city has only existed since the 12th century and is thus one of Europe's youngest capitals. The Red Square and the adjacent Kremlin are highlights of the visitor's tour of the city. At one side of the Red Square is the Lenin Mausoleum, a permanent tribute to the founder of the modern Soviet state. Beyond the Kremlin are the nine domed towers of the Basilius Cathedral, built between 1555 and 1560.
