With over seven million inhabitants, London is one of the world's largest and most important commercial trading centers. The tourist attractions of London can easily be reached on foot, or by taking the tube or one of the famous red London buses. Visitors to the city are always impressed by the giant twin towers of Tower Bridge. The bridge can open in only 90 seconds to allow tall ships to pass. The bridge was built in 1894, and since that date the drawbridge has never failed to function.
