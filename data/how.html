		<h2>Preparation: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> The user can select to play a new game or load the last saved game (a game can be saved by a user at any time in playing the game during the user’s turn).
			<li> If the user selects to start a new game, then the user selects the number of players, the name of each player and the type: computer or user.
			<li> Each player receives a playing piece, a flag of the same color and a flight plan.
			<li> The place cards are sorted into three piles according to the color at the top of the card.
			<li> The players now receive their first place card; these are dealt as follows: the first player receives a red one, the second green, the next yellow, the next red and so on.
			<li> The city shown on a player's first card is both beginning and end of his/her journey.
			<li> The game starts with the flags next to these cities on the board.
			<li> Now each player receives two more cards (there are eight more cards dealt in the real game, but we have to test it with less – implement an easy programming setup to change the number of cards dealt to eight). These are dealt so that each player has a total of one card in each color. They indicate the cities to be visited on the journey through Europe. To make it easier to find these cities, each card is marked with a letter and a number which correspond to the grid marked around the edges of the board. Some place cards are illustrated, featuring tourist attractions. These cards also have special instructions on the reverse. A further educational aspect of the game is that the place cards are marked on the front with the town and city names in the native language of their country. The English name appears on the back of the cards.
			<li> Players should look at all of their cards at the beginning of the game, take note of any instructions and thereby plan the quickest and most suitable route.
