The capital of Greece has much to offer: the size and character of a modern city, as well as witness to a gorgeous past, which 2,500 years ago offered the ultimate in spiritual culture and art. The most important archaeological site is the Acropolis, built on a limestone hill. It includes some of the best creations of Greek architecture, especially the magnificent Parthenon. Modern Athens has spread out far and wide, and now reaches right down to the port of Piraeus on the Aegean Sea.
