Reykjavik is the capital city of Iceland, which is situated in the North Atlantic, just south of the Arctic Circle. Iceland is about 600 miles from the European mainland. Only one quarter of the land is of any economic or agricultural use. The people of Iceland live mainly on a diet offish, and the industry also provides the major source of revenue for the country. There is still regular volcanic activity on the island; about every five years there is an eruption. indeed, in 1963, one such emption actually led to the creation of a new island Â­Surtsey. The many geysers are a great attraction for the intrepid visitors to Iceland. These geysers are powerful warm springs, which regularly shoot water and steam hundreds of feet into the air.
