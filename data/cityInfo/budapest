Budapest is a beautiful and interesting city. It lies in the heart of Europe, on both banks of the Danube. On the right bank is Buda, in a hilly, wooded area. On the opposite bank is the city area of Pest, built on much flatter land. It was in 1872 that the two formerly independent cities united under the name Budapest.
