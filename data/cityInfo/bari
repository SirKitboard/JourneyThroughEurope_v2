Bari is the capital of its region and the second largest city in southern Italy. If this harbor city is approached from inland, the  traveler will pass miles and miles of barren land in the Trulli area. There are virtually no human inhabitants around, only a few olive trees. The only relief from this monotony is provided by the pockets of strange looking Trulli Â­ small, round huts, which are uninhabited. The roofs are dome shaped and the only source of daylight is through the door.
