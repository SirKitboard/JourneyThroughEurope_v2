Visitors who approach Helsinki by sea enjoy a wonderful view of the "white city of the north'" just before their arrival in port, when the light-colored buildings start to appear. These include the presidential palace, the Town Hall, the Swedish Embassy and the cathedral. From the terraces round the cathedral dome, there is a superb view of the harbor and the city.
