Copenhagen has developed from a very small fishing village into a very large city with â€¢ its own unique atmosphere. For tourists, the older part of the city is of most interest, with its pedestrian areas, small squares, fascinating shops, well-kept old buildings and, of course, its canals. The best known park in Copenhagen is famous throughout the world: Tivoli land. It is a pleasure garden sited on almost 80,000 square meters of land between the main station and the Town Hall. All kinds of entertainment are to be found there: big wheels, big dippers, ghost trains, puppet shows and in the evening, concerts, pantomimes, ballet and the theatre.
