The harbor of this busy city is over 800 years old. Countless buildings from the 18th century are living proof of the riches that the old trade with North America brought to the city. Bristol is a convenient starting point for trips to different areas of the West Country, such as the old spa city of Bath and Salibury Plains. On these plains lies Stonehenge, one of the world's most famous archaeological sites. The giant stone circles are thought by many to have been built for sun worship.
