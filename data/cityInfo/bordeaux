Bordeaux is the focal point of one of the main winegrowing regions of France, and many of its inhabitants live from this trade. There are more than 2,000 "chateaux" there, and the fruits of their combined labours are exported throughout the world. The largest open square in Europe is in Bordeaux; the Place de Quinconces (126,000 sq.m.). To the north of the city, near the Gironde river, is the only French caviar producing area.
