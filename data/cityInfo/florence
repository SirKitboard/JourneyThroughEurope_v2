The capital of Toscana is renowned throughout the world for its buildings and treasures. The famous cathedral lies next to the magnificent Vecchio Palace, with its single dominant tower. Across the Arno lies the Pitti Palace. The Ponte Vecchio over the river has boasted shops ever since the 13th century. In 1593 Fernandina I ordered that only gold items should be sold in these shops. Nearly four hundred years later, the shopkeepers on the bridge still sell mainly gold jewelry and trinkets.
