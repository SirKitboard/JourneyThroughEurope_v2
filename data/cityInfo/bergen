The provincial capital of Bergen is surrounded by seven mountains. The old harbor is one of the most beautiful in Europe. It's worth taking time to visit the old part of Bergen; the fish market, Edvard Griegs House, Troldhaugen and Floyen. Many visitors are attracted to the town by the festivals in May and June, which are closely connected with the name of Edvard Griegs. Nearby is the Voringfoss, Norway's most famous waterfall, falling from a height of 600 feet.
