The statue of Joan of Arc in the town celebrates the occasion in 1429 when she saved Orleans from the attacking English and Burgundian armies. The day after her victory, 8th May, a festival was held in celebration. This tradition has been continued right up to the present day. The Joan of Arc Festival is one of the most spectacular of its kind in France.
