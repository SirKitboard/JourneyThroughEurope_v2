Istanbul is the largest ci ty, largest port and largest business center in Turkey. The city lies in a hilly area on either side of the Bosporus Straits. Eastern splendor and the modern western world combine to make Istanbul, formerly Constantinople - an experience the visitor will long remember. There are magnificent examples of Byzantine art throughout the city, including the fabled "Hagia Sofia". This was built between 532 and 537 as a church. It became a mosque soon after the Turks took over the city, and today it is a museum.
