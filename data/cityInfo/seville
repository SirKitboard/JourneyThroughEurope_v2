The capital of Andalusia is 40 miles from the Atlantic coast, but nevertheless one of Spain's largest ports. The River Guadalquivir can be negotiated by ocean-going ships right up to Seville. Shortly after Holy Week, the famous annual festival is held. For six full days, the city is a sea of color as processions, dances and bullfights take place. The festival was first held in the 19th century and is one of the most famous in the whole of Spain.
