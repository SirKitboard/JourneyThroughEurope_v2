Whoever thinks that Berlin consists of rows of grey houses has obviously never been there! Which other city has so many lakes, woods and parks? You can even still see farmhouses with fields of corn in Berlin. There are countless museums, astounding old and new buildings, zoological gardens, an aquarium, the Zeiss Planetarium and a modern city center. Berlin is also a favorite conference and exhibition center. The Congress Hall was built in 1957 as the American contribution to the International Building Exhibition. It was designed by the American architect Stubbins.
