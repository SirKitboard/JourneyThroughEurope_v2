Spain's second largest city is one of the most important ports in the Mediterranean. The visitor to Barcelona can enjoy both a bustling harbor area, dating back to the Middle Ages, and a modern, elegant city center. Worthy of a visit, too, are the Ramblas, the old city walls, which provide the venue for a lovely evening walk on a clear night. An interesting feature of Barcelona is the Sagra da Familia Church . Built by the well-known architect Antonio Gaudi towards the end of the 19th century, it was never actually finished. It includes examples of all possible building styles.
