Dublin is an important trading and administration center and hosts the largest brewery in Europe (Guinness). The city is the cultural center of Eire and a long list of famous literary figures is connected with Dublin: Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, James Joyce and Sean O'Casey. Much loved by visitors to Ireland are the Romany Caravans, which can be rented and used to travel at a sedate pace through the beautiful rolling countryside. Alternatively, visitors can enjoy a leisurely barge cruise on the many inland waters.
