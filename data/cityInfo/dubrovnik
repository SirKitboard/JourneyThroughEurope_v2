Dubrovnik is the most popular holiday resort on the Yugoslavian side of the Adriatic. The city is even known as "Queen of the Adriatic". In the 15th and 16th centuries the small port was one of the major trading centers of the area, always in fierce competition with Venice. The old town center is still surrounded by a large defensive wall. A circuit of the wall is less than two miles, and the effort is rewarded with fine views of the city, the sea and the countryside.
