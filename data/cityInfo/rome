Nowadays the capital only of Italy, Rome was once the capital of an Empire which stretched over most of Europe. The starkest reminder of those days of power and fortune is the Coliseum - Rome's largest amphitheater. It was built by Emperor Titus in 80 AD, and was the venue for such spectacles as gladiator and animal fights.
