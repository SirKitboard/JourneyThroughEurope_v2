The reputation of Dresden as one of Germany's most beautiful cities can be traced back to the fine buildings constructed during the years of splendor in the 17th and 18th centuries. The castle dates from that time, as do the palace and gardens, the Japanese Palace and the larger churches. In modern-day Dresden, the art gallery is held in high regard throughout the world.
