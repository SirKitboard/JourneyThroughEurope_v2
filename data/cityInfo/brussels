In 1958, as a symbol of the World Fair, the Atomium was built in Laeken Park near Brussels. This unique building is completely covered with aluminum and represents an iron molecule enlarged 15 billion times. It is 330 feet high and consists of nine giant balls, each 60 feet in diameter, joined together by ten feet thick tubes. The park is open all year round.
