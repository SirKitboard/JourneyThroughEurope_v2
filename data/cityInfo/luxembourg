For centuries the city of Luxembourg found itself changing hands over and over again as it was occupied by various conquering armies. It has been a walled city ever since the 10th century and each successive invader has further strengthened the fortifications. Attractions of the old inner city include the cathedral, St Michael's Church and the Grand Ducal Palace_ The palace is a Renaissance building of 1572, originally serving as the Town Hall. Luxembourg has been one of the Common Market administration centers since 1973.
