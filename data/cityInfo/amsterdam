Amsterdam is the largest and most important city in The Netherlands. The historic inner city is one of the largest in the world. It has a wonderful atmosphere, due mainly to the many canals found there. One of the oldest of these canals is the Singel Canal, which formed the western perimeter of the city in the 16th century. The Coin Tower stands where this canal flows into the Amstel. Coins were minted there in the 17th century. It is now the site of a floating flower market.
