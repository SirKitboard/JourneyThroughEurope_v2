This is one of Germany's oldest cities. It was back in the year 50 AD that Emperor Claudius granted the name Colonia Ara Agrippinensis to the settlement there. Modern-day Cologne is a busy trading and industry center, with countless banks and a giant exhibition Clrena. The Cologne 'Dam' is the largest gothic cathedral in Germany. It was started in 1248, but only finished in its present form in 1880. With its fine collection of treasures, it remains one of Europe's most important cathedrals.
